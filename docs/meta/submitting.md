# Submitting Notes

## 1. `git push` it
To synchronise your changes with the online repo, execute the `git push` command, either through the version control UI in your IDE, or using the command lone.

Make sure you are on the correct branch!
Pushing to `main` is not allowed, and *should* throw an error &mdash; you must push to your own branch first!

## 2. Pull/Merge Request
Once you've pushed your changes, visit the GitHub URL for your repository, and file a Pull Request (into --> `main`).

## 3. The Review Process
Get someone to review your notes, then if they accept the changes it will be automagically updated on the website (after like 3 mins).
